/* ------------------------ notes ------------------------ */

- create reusable dropdown popup to use in menubar and combobox
- interpolate between gradient pixels and target color/gradient in
  memorydc?
  
/* --------------- customizable attributes --------------- */

the layout for customizing an attribute is

| element | property | state |

for example: "checkbox_backgroundcolor_default" refers to the
checkbox's background when the object's state is default.

some properties will not have a particular element assigned to
them. its value will be assigned to the object as a whole. for
example, we wouldn't want different mouse cursors when he hover over
the checkbox itself and when he hover over the text label (or maybe we
might, but might over complicate the implementation)

properties include:

| property        | has element | element examples                                   |
| backgroundcolor | yes         | drawingarea, checkbox, radiobutton, staticbox, etc |
| bordercolor     | yes         | drawingarea, checkbox, radiobutton, staticbox, etc |
| borderwidth     | yes         | checkbox, radiobutton, etc                         |
| cornerradius    | yes         | checkbox, combobox, staticbox, etc                 |
| textseparation  | yes         | checkbox, radiobutton, image                       |
| textside        | yes         | checkbox, radiobutton, image                       |
| textcolor       | no          |                                                    |
| textfont        | no          |                                                    |
| textsize        | no          |                                                    |
| textstyle       | no          |                                                    |
| mousecursor     | no          |                                                    |
| path            | yes         | image                                              |
| width           | yes         | checkbox, image                                    |
| height          | yes         | checkbox, image                                    |
| radius          | yes         | radiobutton                                        |

the object states are:

| state   |
| default |
| hover   |
| pressed |
| default |

all objects will have a "use_defaults" option that will make the
object's drawing method use the default state values, regardless of
its state. this is helpful for objects that are not intended to behave
like controls. for example, we normally don't want to use a different
background color every time the user hovers over a panel, but this is
easily modifiable.

the "elements" refer to a section that is drawn inside the object
interface. for example, a checkbox has: the checkbox itself, a text
label, and optionally an image.
